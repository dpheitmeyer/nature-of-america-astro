Temperate rain forest stretches along the Pacific coast from northern California to the Gulf of Alaska. Characterized by the occurrence of Sitka spruce, this ecosystem typically occupies a relatively narrow strip between the ocean and the mountains. The climate is mild and very wet-average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 160 inches. Summer fogs are common, and intense winter storms bring large amounts of rain and strong winds.

Immense old-growth conifers form a canopy over a luxuriant understory of ferns, mosses, herbs, and shrubs. This ecosystem supports the greatest accumulation of organic material per square mile in the world. The rain forest is home to many bird and mammal species; some populations have been seriously reduced in size. Numerous streams and rivers abound with fish and amphibians.
